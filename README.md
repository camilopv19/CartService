#

Run the project by running `dotnet run` on the Carting folder.

For this version of the project, first a console app will be displayed, for the receiver client to wait for messages.

If one message is received, the respective operations will be executed and the results will be logged on the console.

After that, the (CLI) program will finish and will wait for a key to be pressed. Then the swagger page (for Cart or "Basket" API) will be displayed, where the updated item by the message broker will be in a new Cart. So it's recommended to run the Get Carts method to see the changes.
